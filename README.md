The recommended chips are:
PIC32MZ2048EF064I/PT	64-pin TQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 200 MHz
PIC32MZ2048EFH064-250I/PT	64-pin TQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 252 MHz
PIC32MZ2048EFG100-I/PF	100-pin TQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 200 MHz
PIC32MZ2048EFG144-I/PL	144-pin LQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 200 MHz
PIC32MZ2048EFH100-250I/PF	100-pin TQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 252 MHz
PIC32MZ2048EFH144-250I/PL	144-pin LQFP package (0.5 mm pin pitch) – maximum speed 252 MHz

The chips PIC32MZ2048EFM064-I/PT , PIC32MZ2048EFM100-I/PF and PIC32MZ2048EFM144-I/PL can also be used at 200 MHz. In addition the 0.4mm chips may be used but are harder to solder by hand (PT for 100-pin and PH for 144-pin)
